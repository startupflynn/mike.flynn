<p>Hello Startup Institute! My name is Michael Flynn and I'm enrolling in the Product & Design track after ~9 years as a UX Researcher and Designer at Verizon. I'm looking forward to dusting the cobwebs off some practical tech skills (i.e., not a code guy), exploring projects / teams / companies where I might help (i.e., finding a job I love), and making new friends who I might help or who might help me along the way (i.e., you)!</p>
