<h1>Michael Flynn | UX Design Superhero</h1>

<p>Hello! My name is Michael Flynn and I'm in Startup Institute - Boston's Product & Design track! After ~9 years as a UX Researcher and Designer at Verizon, I'm looking forward to dusting the cobwebs off some practical tech skills, exploring projects / teams / companies where I might help, and making new friends who I might help or who might help me along the way!
